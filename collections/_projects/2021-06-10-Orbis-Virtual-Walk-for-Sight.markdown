#### Orbis Virtual Walk for Sight
The annual Orbis Walk for Sight family fundraisers will take the form of a virtual event in 2021. Orbis invites participants to challenge, in 6 weeks, a total of 66,000,000 steps which is equivalent to the distance of travelling around the world, symbolising the significance of bringing Orbisâ€™s sight-saving power to places in needed. Our popular mascot, Seymour the Bear, will be online to help you win exciting prizes such as an Orbis Walk for Sight Ambassador title as you will explore nature, complete designated steps and the various photo-taking challenges. This will also be the first Orbis walkathon where pets can come join the fun!
