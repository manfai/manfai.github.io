The spirit of giving transcends space, time and age. Likewise, physical exercises are fun to do by young and old alike anytime, anywhere – sports and charity make a good match indeed! Now, not only will you stay fit and happy as you do your favourite sport, you will also make a difference to the life of the people in need. Don’t miss the chance to send good vibes and blessings to the community at large.

‘JY Grandmark Presents: PLK 2020 Virtual Sports Challenge – Let’s Get Moving!’ aims to invite people of all ages to be on the move whenever and wherever they like. From at-home workouts and jogging around the neighbourhood to entertaining family activities and ball games, just record on the campaign website the time you spend exercising indoors or outdoors every day and keep track of your fitness journey. Participants are encouraged to make exercise a daily habit by doing 45 minutes of physical activities with everyone in the family each day. The more you exercise, the more the Kuk will receive in donations to support its vast array of services.

Don’t forget to share the memorable moments of your fitness journey on Facebook, WhatsApp or Twitter to appeal for support and donations from your family and friends. Participants who have raised HK$500 or above will receive a limited edition PLK-themed Ludo game to have some extra fun.
