<p>I build a ordering system for different organization/company to pursue their lunch based on EC Bento System. And the First client for this system is a International School. They have are two department of primary school and secondary school. That why I adjusted the function. I added student management function and ordering cut-off function.
As my know, student would be assign meal by manual. Staff need to download the report from the system.  According to a report downloaded. They would be arrange meal for student. 
Parents can add student infomation to Student management function and they can make a order for student.</p>
